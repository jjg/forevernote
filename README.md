Print once, keep forever

Forevernote is a storage device that appears on your network as a printer.  When you print to Forevernote, instead of producing a hardcopy, a PDF is produced and stored safely on the device.  To access these PDFs a web-based search interface is provided in addition to a REST API that can be used to integrate Forevernote with other devices and services.

PDFs are indexed by both their contents and any metadata that is avaliable when they are stored.  For example, you can search for files that were created on a specific date, or printed from a specific device.  Since anything that can be printed from any device can be archived in Forevernote, searching the contents can include source-specific values like the URL of an archived web page or the title of an archived word processing document.

Since eveything is archived in PDF form, the archives can be retrieved and viewed regardless of changes to the original source and can be read on almost any device.  Another advantage of using the PDF format is that Forevernote requires no Internet connextion and can be used completely offline.
